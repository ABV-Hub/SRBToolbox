function [w, dt] = ricker(f)% [w, dt] = ricker(f)% creates a Ricker wavelet, defined as the second derivative of a Gaussian%% inputs:%    f  = desired center frequency of wavelet%% outputs:%    w = output wavelet, with peak amplitude of 1%        has an odd number of samples, so time zero is center value%    dt = time sample interval%  written by Gary Mavko, 5/01dt = 0.065/f;dt = 0.130/f;a = 5*dt;t = [-3*a: dt: 3*a];w = -2.*((t./a).^2 - 0.5).*exp(-(t/a).^2);
